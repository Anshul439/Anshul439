# Hi there friends 👋

I'm Anshul, a first-year Computer Science student. I began my coding journey at the age of 15, and Java became one of my favorite languages. Alongside Java, I'm proficient in Python, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. Currently, I'm diving into the world of Web Development. Feel free to explore my portfolio - [Anshul's Website](https://anshul439.github.io/Personal-Website/)

When I'm not coding, you'll find me indulging in my hobbies: 
- 🥁 Playing the drums
- ⚽️ Playing football
- 📚 Reading
- ✍️ Writing.
